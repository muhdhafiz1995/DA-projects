--- Overview of table

SELECT * 
FROM [Portfolio projects]..CovidDeaths;
SELECT continent, location, date, population, total_cases, new_cases
FROM [Portfolio projects]..CovidDeaths
WHERE continent is not null
Order by 2,4

--- Zooming into the cases in Singapore

SELECT continent, location, date, population, total_cases, new_cases
FROM [Portfolio projects]..CovidDeaths
WHERE location = 'Singapore'
ORDER BY date

--- Sorting table by number of new cases

SELECT continent, location, date, population, total_cases, new_cases
FROM [Portfolio projects]..CovidDeaths
WHERE location = 'Singapore'
ORDER BY new_cases DESC

--- Global Numbers by date


SELECT date, SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as total_deaths, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int))/SUM(New_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
FROM [Portfolio projects]..CovidDeaths
WHERE continent is not null
Group by date
Order by 1,2

--- Global Numbers in total

SELECT SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as total_deaths, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int))/SUM(New_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
FROM [Portfolio projects]..CovidDeaths
WHERE continent is not null
Order by 1,2

--- Looking at Total Population vs Vaccinations

SELECT dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations, SUM(CAST(vac.new_vaccinations as bigint)) OVER (Partition by dea.location Order by dea.location, dea.date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
FROM [Portfolio projects]..CovidDeaths dea
Join [Portfolio projects]..CovidVaccine vac
   On dea.location = vac.location
   and dea.date = vac.date
where dea.continent is not null
Order by 2,3
